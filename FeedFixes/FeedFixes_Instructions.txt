Fixes to XML feed

** Line 68 ** (xml syntax error)
Notice that some special characters such as &, >, <, ', and " must 
be replaced with &amp;, &gt;, &lt, &apos;, and &quot;, respectivelly. 

So, the line 68 

<Name>Awesome Possum T-shirt & Shorts Red</Name>

shall be replaced by

<Name>Awesome Possum T-shirt &amp; Shorts Red</Name>

Reference: https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_syntax.asp (see "Entity References" Section)



** Lines 52 ** (Olapic's scheme validation error)
The ProductUniqueID field is required to be a string of 1 or more consececutive characters
(i.e. no spaces)

So, line 52

'ProductUniqueID': 'APTS-02 Blue'

shall be replaced by something like (suggestion)

'ProductUniqueID': 'APTS-02-Blue'



** Line 73 ** (Olapic's scheme validation error)
CategoryID cannot be empty. This field has the same requirements as ProductUniqueID
(see previous fix)

So, line 73

<CategoryID />

shall be replaced by something like (suggestion)

<CategoryID>cat1234</CategoryID>

or 

<CategoryID>some_other_category_id</CategoryID>

Please, asign a proper CategoryID to the product with id equal to "APTS-03".
